/**
 * **Gate 2 — the PR/code review gate** (GATES brief `work/briefs/tasked/review.md`), the
 * JUDGEMENT layer that rides ON TOP of the deterministic `verify` floor (ADR §8).
 *
 * After the green `verify` and BEFORE the done-move, `complete`/`do` invoke the
 * `review` SKILL (`skills/review/SKILL.md`) as a **fresh-context** agent — its
 * OWN harness launch, never the builder's session — to read the diff against the
 * task it claims and EMIT a verdict. The verdict is then ROUTED by the caller
 * (`complete.ts`): `approve` → done-move/commit/integrate; `block` → the SAME
 * `needs-attention` machinery the red gate uses (never a merge).
 *
 * This module is the SEAM (the {@link ReviewGate} function type) + its
 * production harness-backed implementation ({@link harnessReviewGate}). The seam
 * is injectable exactly like `do`'s `agentRunner`: tests stub a canned
 * `approve`/`block` verdict (no real model); production launches the review agent
 * through the EXISTING harness seam ({@link Harness}/`LaunchInput`), routing the
 * `reviewModel` override through `LaunchInput.model` / {@link substituteModel} —
 * NOT a new model/launch mechanism (the §13 model-routing intent).
 *
 * Determinism boundary (ADR §8), explicit: review is a JUDGEMENT gate, never a
 * replacement for `verify`. `verify` stays the non-skippable model-free floor;
 * review runs ON TOP, only when `review` resolves on.
