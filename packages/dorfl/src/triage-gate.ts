/**
 * The **TRIAGE auto-disposition GATE** (prd `advance-loop`, task
 * `advance-rung-triage`, US #17) — the CONSERVATIVE, `observationTriage: 'auto'`-
 * gated exception to the question-gated default. On `classify=triage-observation`
 * AND `observationTriage` resolved to `'auto'`, the engine asks this gate whether
 * the observation is a NO-QUESTION case (one
 * a human would not plausibly disagree with): an EXACT DUPLICATE of an existing
 * item (→ suggest delete) or an UNAMBIGUOUS MAP onto an existing item. If so, the
 * engine auto-dispositions it WITHOUT surfacing a question; otherwise it falls back
 * to the always-allowed question-gated path (surface a promote/keep/delete
 * question and WAIT).
 *
 * The HIGH BAR is the whole point: the gate emits `auto: false` for ANYTHING that
 * is a judgement call. It NEVER auto-promotes (promotion is "is this worth
 * building?", always a human call) and NEVER auto-deletes a NON-duplicate signal
 * (the capture-bucket contract: an observation is left by deletion BY A HUMAN). So
 * the ONLY auto-dispositions this gate may return are:
 *
 *   - `duplicate` — an EXACT duplicate of an existing item → RECOMMEND deletion
 *     (the human still deletes per the capture-bucket contract; the agent only
 *     recommends, exactly as the apply rung's `delete` disposition does); or
 *   - `map` — an UNAMBIGUOUS map onto an existing item → record the mapping +
 *     `triaged:keep` (the observation is settled onto its existing home; it drops
 *     out of the pool, never re-asked).
 *
 * It is the DIRECT mirror of `surface-gate.ts`'s spawn→emit→parse seam, with a
 * narrower emitted payload (`{auto, …}` rather than `{questions}`). Production
 * launches a fresh-context agent through the EXISTING harness seam; tests stub a
 * canned decision (no real model). The auto-disposition WRITE (record + resolve)
 * is the engine's job (`triage-persist.ts`); this module only JUDGES.
