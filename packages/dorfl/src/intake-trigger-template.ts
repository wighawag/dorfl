/**
 * The `install-ci` ISSUE-INTAKE capability (spec `runner-in-ci`, task
 * `install-ci-intake-trigger-and-review-surface`; capability D: consider incoming
 * issues → task/spec, AND insertion point E: surface the review verdict back into
 * the issue thread). This module GENERATES the one fixed intake workflow file and
 * STRUCTURALLY VALIDATES it, mirroring the snapshot-assertion style of
 * `advance-lifecycle-template.ts` / `advance-ci-template.ts` (the package depends on
 * NO YAML lib, so the checks are presence/shape assertions over the raw text). It
 * ALSO carries the PURE author-trust → per-outcome-flags DERIVATION
 * ({@link deriveIntakeFlags}) — CI's merge-vs-propose POLICY, the load-bearing
 * testable logic the workflow encodes at runtime.
 *
 * SCOPE FENCE (spec Out-of-Scope): the issue→artifact TRANSFORM engine is
 * `issue-intake`'s (`intake <N>` + its four-outcome dispatch + the per-outcome
 * KNOBS + the lone-task review that posts to the issue thread). CI only
 * WIRES/SCHEDULES/INVOKES it and owns the merge-vs-propose POLICY + the delivery
 * surface. This module emits NO transform; it emits the WORKFLOW that calls it.
 *
 * The discipline (spec capability-D row + the merge-vs-propose POLICY + the two
 * RESOLVED design decisions in the task):
 *
 *   - TRIGGERS: `issues` opened, `issue_comment` created, and a label
 *     (`dorfl:intake`). It invokes `intake <N>` (EXPLICIT, four-outcome
 *     dispatch) — never a bare slug.
 *   - EVENT→`IntakeEventKind` MAPPING (Decision 2: no edit-detection): only a
 *     CREATED `issue_comment` (and an opened issue / the label) drives
 *     (re-)evaluation; an EDITED comment is NOT a trigger (the ID-based
 *     `seen=<ids>` watermark suffices). The "post a NEW comment to signal an edit"
 *     convention is documented in the workflow so a human knows to re-trigger.
 *   - AUTHOR-TRUST → PLACEMENT + the STAMP, never the file-emit MODE (ADR
 *     `untrusted-origin-carries-via-stamp-not-forced-staging`; {@link
 *     deriveIntakeFlags}): author-trust NO LONGER derives the task/spec
 *     merge-vs-propose file-emit mode. It feeds exactly (1) the `--origin-trust`
 *     STAMP (`author_association` not in OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR ⇒ `untrusted`)
 *     and (2) — via that stamp, read by `intake`'s dispatch — which PLACEMENT
 *     default (`untrusted*LandIn` vs `*LandIn`) the emitted document lands in. The
 *     file-emit MODE is now GATE-DERIVED for BOTH types (`--merge-*` iff the
 *     matching auto-gate is OFF, else `--propose-*`), symmetric and
 *     trust-independent. Untrusted safety is the CARRIED stamp (it forces the
 *     BUILD transition to a code PR) plus the placement default, NOT a forced
 *     document PR. A document therefore merges to `main` regardless of who filed
 *     the issue; whether it is later reviewed-as-a-PR is the operator's
 *     per-transition config, not a trust consequence.
 *   - INSERTION POINT E (the issue-thread review surface): the review verdict over
 *     intake's generated specs/tasks is surfaced into the ISSUE THREAD via the
 *     `IssueProvider.postIssueComment` seam (issue thread, by NUMBER — NOT the PR
 *     seam `postPRComment`, which is keyed by url). This is REUSED, not new:
 *     `intake <N>` already runs the lone-task review/edit loop and posts its
 *     findings as questions through `postIssueComment`. The workflow surfaces E by
 *     INVOKING `intake`; it adds no second review mechanism.
 *   - CI runs IN-PLACE (the CI container IS the isolation): no
 *     `--isolated`/`--remote`/registry. A PER-ISSUE concurrency group serialises
 *     overlapping ticks on the SAME issue; the `processing` lock / claim CAS is the
 *     real cross-run serialiser.
 *   - The running CI job NEVER edits `.github/workflows/**` (US #9): it requests NO
 *     `workflows` permission and cannot rewrite its own triggers. It needs
 *     `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` (emit/propose the artifact) +
 *     `issues: write` (post the clarifying/review comment back).
 *
 * The structural validator is the dependency-free counterpart of "the workflow
 * parses + carries the right discipline" the task's acceptance criteria require;
 * the test generates this artifact under `--fake` and asserts every invariant.
