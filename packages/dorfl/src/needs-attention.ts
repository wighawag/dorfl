/**
 * The **needs-attention mechanism** (ADR `ledger-status-on-per-item-lock-refs`;
 * spec `ledger-status-per-item-lock-refs`; ADR §12 for the original folder model).
 * Every "couldn't finish, a human must look" outcome (a failed acceptance gate
 * (red `verify`), a rebase/merge conflict (ADR §10), a task the agent reported
 * too ambiguous to build, a timeout, or a rejected review) resolves to ONE
 * observable move: the RUNNER AMENDS the claimed item's HELD per-item lock
 * `active → stuck` (`refs/dorfl/lock/<entry>`), writing the reason (+ any
 * agent-surfaced questions) into the lock-entry BODY. There is NO `git mv` to a
 * `work/needs-attention/` folder and NO on-`main` surface (the lock cut-over,
 * task `cutover-needs-attention-becomes-lock-stuck-recovery-surface`): so a
 * protected-`main` bounce succeeds, and a work branch cut from `main` inherits no
 * stuck record. The RECOVERABLE half is the kept `work/<slug>` branch.
 *
 * This is the conflict-safe form of "surfacing": the surface is the lock
 * `state: stuck`, read by `scan`/`status`/`gc --ledger` reading the lock refs (a
 * COMMAND a human runs, not an `ls` of a folder). There is **no status/label
 * field** on `main` (honours WORK-CONTRACT rule 3). The reason is prose in the
 * lock-entry body, never a source-of-truth frontmatter field.
 *
 * Ownership: this module OWNS the mechanism (the move helper + the surface
 * reader + the return path). Consumers (`complete.ts`'s gate-failed/rebase-
 * conflict abort paths, the runner's stuck routing in `run.ts`, the human
 * `return` command) drive these through the ledger write seam's NEEDS-ATTENTION
 * transition (`ledgerWrite.applyNeedsAttentionTransition` /
 * `applyReturnToBacklogTransition` in `ledger-write.ts`), whose sole strategy
 * delegates to `routeToNeedsAttention` / `returnToBacklog` here UNCHANGED — so
 * the later cherry-pick-to-`main` surfacing is built AGAINST the seam, not
 * bolted onto this move code. The build agent NEVER does this — agents do no git
 * (ADR §12).

 *      on. The work-branch push is NOT a `main` write.
 *
 * The stuck STATE itself (the `state: stuck` + reason/questions) is owned by the

/**
 * PR-1 ADDITIVE primitive (task `bounce-surfaces-stuck-sidecar-and-releases-lock`).
 * The 2-file SIBLING of {@link prepareTreelessMoveCommit}: pure git plumbing
 * (`hash-object` / scratch-index `update-index` / `write-tree` /
 * `commit-tree`, NEVER touches the caller's index/HEAD/working tree) that in
 * ONE commit off {@link base} both
 *
 *   1. writes or appends to the item's `work/questions/<type>-<slug>.md`
 *      sidecar (see {@link sidecarPathFor}) a `stuck`-kind entry carrying the
 *      bounce {@link reason} plus any agent-surfaced {@link questions}, and
 *   2. sets `needsAnswers: true` on the item body at {@link itemPath} (via
 *      {@link setNeedsAnswersMarker}).
 *
 * The current sidecar (if any) and the current item body are read as BLOBS off
 * `<arbiter>/main` (via {@link catBlob}) — no working tree required and no
 * dependency on the cwd's `HEAD` matching `main`. That is what makes this the
 * tree-less path's surface primitive: a `applyTreelessNeedsAttentionTransition`
 * caller (`continue-push-failure` / rebase-conflict) has NO writable-`main`
 * checkout, so `persistSurfacedQuestions` (working-tree bound) cannot be reused;
 * the pure CONTENT builders (`newSidecar` / `appendQuestions` /
 * `serialiseSidecar` / `setNeedsAnswersMarker`) ARE reused, only the commit
 * mechanism differs (spec decision #7).
 *
 * Returns the throwaway ref + commit sha, exactly like {@link
 * prepareTreelessMoveCommit}, so the SAME {@link runTreelessLedgerMove} CAS loop
 * publishes the surface commit through the shared write seam. The
 * surface-first / release-second ordering + `main`-authoritative crash-safety
 * (spec decision #4) come FREE from routing through that loop — the caller wires
 * the release into a `finally` AFTER a successful publish (see the harness
 * {@link surfaceStuckToNeedsAttention}).
 *
 * DECISION — sidecar entry shape for a reason-only bounce (build-time, PR-1):
 * every bounce always appends ONE engine-authored `stuck`-kind envelope entry
 * whose `question` names the item and whose `context` is the {@link reason}
 * prose, THEN any {@link questions} the agent surfaced. So a reason-only bounce
 * (no agent questions) still surfaces exactly ONE entry a human can answer, and
 * the agent's own questions (when present) are appended AFTER it, verbatim. The
 * envelope entry is what turns a raw exit reason into a human-drainable
 * question; the extra entries are the LLM prose the spec's decision #2 keeps
 * untouched. Alternative considered — treating an empty `questions` array as a
 * NO-OP surface — REJECTED because that is the spec's `stuck` retirement
 * problem all over again (a bounced item with no on-`main` outcome).
 * Alternative considered — dropping the envelope when agent questions are given
 * — REJECTED because the reason is engine-authored ground truth; the agent's
 * questions are advisory prose ABOVE it, not a replacement for it.
 *
 * PR-1 boundary: this primitive is EXERCISED BY TESTS ONLY; it is NOT yet
 * called from any bounce seam. Wiring `applyNeedsAttentionTransition` /
 * `applyTreelessNeedsAttentionTransition` to it — and migrating the existing
 * `stuckLockOnArbiter(...).toBe(true)` assertions — is the follow-up PR-2 task
 * `bounce-atomic-cutover-retire-stuck-lock`.

 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. When a build bounces, the surface path atomically
 * writes BOTH halves of the question state in ONE commit: the sidecar
 * `work/questions/<type>-<slug>.md` AND `needsAnswers: true` on the item body.
 * That is correct, and the atomicity is what makes this reconciliation decidable
 * at all. But if the human DISAGREES with the bounce and simply re-dispatches,
 * and the rebuild SUCCEEDS (PR opened, gate green, merged, body done-moved),
 * NEITHER half is ever cleared. The item comes to rest in `tasks/done/` still
 * carrying a question asking whether to CANCEL it, with a destructive default.
 *
 * The flag is the harmful half. A stranded sidecar is a stale question in a
 * folder a human scans; a stranded `needsAnswers` is a GATE LEFT ARMED, and it
 * makes `status` report shipped (sometimes released) work under "open questions
 * block autonomous work".
 *
 * Dorfl ALREADY knows this state is illegal: `advance-classify.ts` refuses it as
 * `invariant-violation` / `sidecar-without-needsAnswers`. The defect is purely
 * that the detector lives in the `advance` tick's classifier, and a human driving
 * `do` and merging a PR never enters that loop. So this is the same shape as the
 * propose-path lock leak, settled by the same reconcile pass at the same moment
 * (the done-move), rather than by a second mechanism.
 *
 * THE TRAP, and why the TERMINAL POSITION is the discriminator rather than the
 * flag/sidecar disagreement: the MIRROR state (`needsAnswers:true` with NO
 * sidecar) is LEGAL and COMMON. An item authored with open questions carries the
 * flag and has no sidecar until `surface` runs, and that flagged-but-unsurfaced
 * item is precisely the `surface` rung's INPUT. Clearing the flag there would
 * silently disarm every un-surfaced item in the repo and hand gated work to
 * agents. So this only ever considers items whose body has reached a TERMINAL
 * folder on `main`; an item resting in a pool or staging folder keeps whatever
 * state it has, untouched.
 *
 * TWO ENUMERATIONS, because the two halves can be separated in either order and
 * a sweep anchored on one is blind to the other:
 *   1. the SIDECAR SET (`work/questions/` on `main`), small and cheap to list,
 *      which finds a stale sidecar and the flag paired with it; and
 *   2. the SUCCESS-TERMINAL BODIES that are flagged with NO sidecar beside them
 *      ({@link collectStrandedTerminalFlags}), which finds the armed gate ALONE.
 *
 * (2) is not optional tidiness. It is the half that actually gates work, and a
 * sweep anchored only on (1) reports success while any gate it cannot see stays
 * armed. The sidecar is the
 * half a human deletes by hand (it is the visible one, in a folder they scan),
 * and deleting it REMOVES the only handle (1) has, stranding the flag for good.
 * The discriminator that keeps (2) safe is POSITION, exactly as for (1): a bare
 * flag is LEGAL on a pool/staging item (the `surface` rung's input) and residue
 * only once the item has shipped, where `surface` can never run again.
 *
 * Best-effort and never throws.

 * folders are the repo's largest and most monotonically growing (this repo holds
 * 404 done tasks), and this runs on the CLAIM path, so reading every terminal
 * body per claim would be a real tax on a hot path. One `git grep -l` returns
 * only the candidates, and the frontmatter parse runs over that short list.
 *
 * The pattern is ANCHORED to match the PARSER rather than the word.
 * `parseFrontmatter` reads keys with `/^([A-Za-z0-9_.]+)\s*:\s*(.*)$/`, so a key
 * it will honour is always at column 0; an unanchored needle instead matches
 * every body that merely DISCUSSES the flag, which in `work/tasks/done/` here is
 * 77 files against 18 anchored, and the truthy form narrows it to 1.
 *
 * The value part is matched LOOSELY on purpose (optional quote, any case),
 * because `toBoolean` unquotes and lower-cases before comparing, so
 * `needsAnswers: 'True'` is a real armed gate. A needle of `:\s*true` would read
 * tighter and be WRONG: it would silently skip those bodies for ever, which is
 * the blind-spot class this function exists to remove. A superset is the safe
 * direction for a shortlist; a subset is not.
 *
 * The grep is still only a CANDIDATE FILTER, never the decision: prose can sit
 * at column 0 too (`needsAnswers: true?` appears in this repo's own bodies), so
 * every hit is confirmed by actually PARSING the frontmatter.
 *
 * Two git-isms are pinned rather than left to the environment:
 *   - `core.quotePath=false`, or git C-quotes any non-ASCII path
 *     (`"work/.../caf\303\251.md"`). A quoted line still starts with the
 *     `<base>:` prefix but then fails the folder-prefix test, so such a body
 *     would be SILENTLY skipped for ever, a permanent blind spot of exactly the
 *     class this function exists to remove.
 *   - `--full-name` + `:(top,literal)` pathspecs, because `git grep`'s pathspecs
 *     are CWD-RELATIVE (unlike the `ls-tree`/`cat-file` probes elsewhere here,
 *     which are tree-relative) and are globs. Without these, running any dorfl
 *     command from a SUBDIRECTORY makes this half a silent no-op while the
 *     sidecar half keeps working.
 *
