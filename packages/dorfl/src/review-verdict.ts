 * ({@link buildReviewPrompt}, {@link buildTaskAcceptancePrompt} in
 * `review-gate.ts`; {@link buildLoneTaskReviewPrompt} in `intake.ts`;
 * {@link buildTaskReviewPrompt} in `tasker-review-loop.ts`) POINTS at

 * for the JSON-emitted-shape prose. None of them re-inlines the lenses or the
 * verdict contract; this module is the single home.
 *
 * The PARSER is the source of truth for the EMITTED SHAPE (D2):
 * `REVIEW-PROTOCOL.md` mirrors what `parseReviewVerdict` enforces (a
 * fixture-matches-doc test pins the two together). Discipline content is owned
