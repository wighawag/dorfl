/**
 * The **AGENTIC apply DECIDER** (spec
 * `agentic-question-resolution-retire-disposition-vocabulary` US #1/#2/#3, task
 * `agentic-apply-retire-disposition-vocabulary`) — the input-ADAPTER + prompt +
 * production decider for the apply rung's call into the SHARED
 * `decide(input, allowedOutcomes)` engine (`decision-engine.ts`). It is the apply
 * rung's analogue of intake's decision seam and `surface-gate.ts` / `triage-gate.ts`:
 * the agent JUDGES (reads the human's answer(s) + the SOURCE item and returns a
 * verdict); the engine VALIDATES it against the allowed set; the apply rung ACTS.
 *
 * This is the SUBSUME of the old disposition vocabulary: there is no longer a
 * `disposition=` token the surface rung stamps and the apply rung executes. When a
 * fully-answered OBSERVATION reaches the apply rung, this decider reads the answer
 * + the source's FULL context (body, type, surrounding signal — decision 3, the
 * analogue of intake reading the whole issue thread) and returns ONE of the LAUNCH
 * outcomes the apply rung allows. The artifact-type SELECTION (task vs spec) comes
 * from the agent's VERDICT, NOT a human `promote-*` field.
 *
 * **The allowed set** (the SUBSET the apply rung passes to `decide`):
 * `{task | spec | adr | delete | ask}` \u2014 i.e. `{mint-task | mint-spec | mint-adr |
 * delete-source | ask-follow-up}`. `adr` was DEFERRED at the keystone launch (no
 * ADR-mint path existed yet) and is now WIRED by the follow-on task
 * `agentic-apply-mint-adr-route`, which added the {@link
 * import('./mint-adr.js').mintAdr} route and widened this set. Intake's set is
 * UNCHANGED (`{task | spec | ask | bounce}`) \u2014 the engine stays outcome-AGNOSTIC
 * (SPEC decision 14), so widening this caller's subset does NOT touch intake or the
 * engine's superset union.
 *
 * The INPUT adapter ({@link buildApplyDecisionInput}) sits HERE in the caller, not
 * in the engine (the engine threads `input` opaquely) \u2014 decision 3: the input
 * adapter is per-front-door and NOT forced to be shared with intake's issue-thread
 * adapter.
 */

/**
 * The allowed-outcome set the apply rung permits. `adr` is now INCLUDED (task
 * `agentic-apply-mint-adr-route` widened the keystone's launch subset, which had
 * deferred it). The engine's superset still carries `adr` either way (it is
 * outcome-agnostic); this is purely the CALLER's permitted subset.
