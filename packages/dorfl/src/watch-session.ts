/**
 * The **`do --watch` observer** (tasks `do-watch` + `do-watch-session-log-format`)
 * — a READ-ONLY concurrent tail of the pi session `.jsonl` event log, restoring
 * for `do` the live agent-conversation view `ar-run.sh --watch` gave.
 *
 * `ar-run.sh --watch` piped `pi -p --mode json | jq` to surface the high-signal
 * events; `do` runs the agent CAPTURED through the harness seam, so that live
 * view was lost. The pi adapter writes a session `.jsonl` at the KNOWN file path
 * the caller generated (`--session <path>`, task `session-path-pi-default`) —
 * but that is pi's SESSION-PERSISTENCE log, a DIFFERENT format from the
 * `--mode json` STREAM `ar-run.sh` piped. The tailer is pointed at that EXACT
 * path (no newest-by-mtime dir guessing), so the stale-sibling race is gone.
 *
 * Studied (task `pi-harness-polish`, finding
 * `work/notes/findings/pi-harness-channels.md`, pinned against pi 0.73.1 +
 * session format v3): tailing the session file is deliberately the CHOSEN
 * channel for `--watch`, not just what was easiest to reuse. `--mode json`'s
 * STDOUT event vocabulary would be lower-latency but it is unversioned, would
 * fork a second parser away from pi-remote's `session-pool.ts` reference walk
 * this classifier mirrors, and the vocabulary-drift risk that already bit
 * `do --watch` once applies MORE to it than to the versioned+migrated session
 * file. Revisit only if pi's session format changes.
 *
 * A session-log record is `{"type":"message", "message":{role, content[]}}` (or a
 * `session`/`model_change`/`thinking_level_change` preamble record). The earlier
 * classifier matched the STREAM vocabulary (`tool_start`/`message_end`/`agent_end`),
 * none of which occur in the session log — so every line fell through to skip and
 * `do --watch` was silently a no-op. This module tails the growing session log and
 * surfaces the same high-signal level `ar-run.sh --watch` gave, read off the
 * SESSION-LOG shape:
 *
 *   - an `assistant` `message` → its `content[]` `text` parts, then
 *     `▶ <name> <detail>` (cyan) per `content[]` `toolCall` part, where
 *     `<detail>` is the high-signal argument for that tool (a `read`'s path, a
 *     `bash`'s command, …), truncated to 64 chars with a trailing `…`;
 *   - `✓ agent finished` (green) on PROCESS EXIT — the session log has no
 *     `agent_end` event, so the tailer emits it once on `stop()`;
 *   - everything else (`session`/`model_change`/user messages/tool results/…) →
 *     skipped.
 *
 * The classifier mirrors pi-remote's `session-pool.ts` reference parser (`type` →
 * `role` → `content[]` block walk over `thinking`/`text`/`toolCall`, incl.
 * `tc.name||tc.toolName` and content-as-string). The JSONL is parsed in TS (NO
 * `jq` — that bash dependency is part of what `do` replaces). It is a PURE
 * OBSERVER: it only READS the log; it never changes the run's outcome, gate,
 * integration, git, or exit code. Colour is honoured ONLY on a TTY / when
 * `NO_COLOR` is unset (the same rule as `output.ts`), threaded in by the caller
 * as a boolean.
