/**
 * The CWD-LOCAL section of `scan`/`status` (the `scan-status-read-cwd-repo`
 * task). When a command runs INSIDE a participating repo, it ALSO reports that
 * CURRENT repo as a clearly-labelled, separately-counted LOCAL section, in
 * addition to (NEVER merged into) the cross-repo REGISTRY view.
 *
 * The consistency rule this module enforces (do not violate):
 *
 *   - The local section reads the LOCAL WORKING TREE (`scanRepoPaths([cwd])`) —
 *     your possibly-uncommitted / unpushed / diverged state — NOT the bare
 *     mirror-ref the registry reads. The two reads have DIFFERENT freshness +
 *     storage models, so they are kept VISUALLY + SEMANTICALLY distinct, each
 *     with its OWN count. A merged grand total would be true in NEITHER model.
 *   - **The SELECTION pool is REMOTE-AUTHORITATIVE + FAILS CLOSED offline.** The
 *     held-lock set (`refs/dorfl/lock/*`) lives ONLY on the arbiter, and it is the
 *     LOAD-BEARING signal that keeps a claimed / in-flight item out of the
 *     eligible pool (the body no longer moves on claim). So the cwd pool reads the
 *     held set from the arbiter (`heldTaskSlugsStrict`) and SUBTRACTS it before
 *     reporting eligibility — exactly as the registry `scan()` does. When the cwd
 *     repo has a configured arbiter but that read cannot reach it, eligibility is
 *     UNKNOWN and the section THROWS rather than emit a confident-but-wrong pool
 *     (the
 *     `scan-cwd-selection-pool-read-local-skips-held-lock-subtraction-offline-must-fail`
 *     decision: offline selection fails; there is NO `--local` fallback). This is
 *     the SELECTION concern; the divergence line is the SURFACE concern and keeps
 *     its graceful warn+last-known behaviour.
 *   - **Fetch-first ALSO for the cwd** (the maintainer's explicit ask): the cwd
 *     repo's arbiter is fetched BEFORE the divergence is computed (the local
 *     working tree is the LEAST authoritative view), reusing the
 *     `scan-status-fetch-first` fetch+warn+fallback discipline — a failed fetch
 *     WARNS and falls back to last-known, NEVER errors out (a read-only command
 *     must degrade, ADR §5/§6).
 *   - The divergence-vs-arbiter is shown with the `main-divergence-guard` framing
 *     (`local main is N commits ahead of <arbiter>/main` = unpushed).
 *   - **De-dup:** if the cwd repo is ALSO registered, it is shown ONCE in the
 *     local section marked "(also registered)" and its registry row is dropped
 *     from the registry list — so the same repo never appears as two mystery
 *     rows with possibly-disagreeing states.
 *
 * The registry model is UNCHANGED by this: `scan`/`status` are read-only DISPLAY
 * surfaces; the daemon (`run`) + the arbiter CAS still claim against the REGISTRY
 * only. Showing the cwd changes nothing about where claims happen.
