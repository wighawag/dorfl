/**
 * `dorfl complete [<slug>] [--skip-verify] [--type <t>] [--message <s>]
 * [--arbiter <remote>]` — the human "finish this" command that runs the same
 * back-half the autonomous runner runs: gate → mark done → commit → integrate.
 *
 * It runs on a `work/<slug>` branch (slug inferred from the branch if omitted).
 * The build agent leaves its work UNCOMMITTED (it does no git), so `complete`
 * `git add -A`s the agent's work AND the done-move into ONE atomic commit. This
 * is the same finish/integration logic `run-once`/`watch` reuse; here it is
 * human-driven and so allows a `--skip-verify` escape hatch the autonomous
 * runner never uses (ADR §8).
 *
 * The item's SOURCE folder is normally `work/in-progress/` (a freshly-built
 * task). As a RUNNER-OWNED RECOVERY path it ALSO accepts an item in
 * `work/needs-attention/` (a SPURIOUSLY-failed task — an env-polluted gate, a
 * transient flake, or a since-fixed cause): when `in-progress/` is absent it
 * falls back to `needs-attention/`, RE-RUNS the gate (authoritative — only a
 * GREEN re-gate completes; a still-red item simply stays in needs-attention/),
 * and on green does the `needs-attention → done` move + commit + rebase +
 * integrate — the SAME machinery, just a different source folder, so a
 * good-but-stuck item is finishable with NO manual git. That recovery rebase
 * also RECONCILES the cherry-picked on-`main` needs-attention surfacing (the
 * done-move supersedes it) so the human never hits a rebase conflict against the
 * surfacing commit. `--skip-verify` stays the only, human-only, loud override.
 *
 * The integration step is split by mode (config `integration`, ADR §6):
 *   merge   — push the rebased branch to `<arbiter>/main`, then sync the LOCAL
 *             clone to that new main (the push is authoritative; the local sync
 *             is the ergonomic finish so the user ends on an up-to-date main).
 *   propose — push the `work/<slug>` branch (the safety-bearing step) and report
 *             the next step. Full provider-driven PR/MR creation lands with the
 *             integration seam; until then `complete` pushes + tells the human.
 *
 * In BOTH modes `complete` lands the human back on local `main` by default
 * ("finish, ready for the next thing") — but the move differs because the work's
 * location differs: `merge` switches to `main` AND fast-forwards it to the just-
 * pushed `<arbiter>/main` (the work landed there); `propose` ONLY `git switch
 * main` (arbiter main has not moved, so there is nothing to ff). `--no-switch`
 * opts out in either mode (stay on `work/<slug>` to keep iterating).
 *
 * After landing on `main`, the LOCAL `work/<slug>` branch is deleted iff its work
 * is provably on the arbiter (the SAME predicate as worktree deletion, ADR §4,
 * mode-agnostic): its tip is an ancestor of `<arbiter>/main` (merged) OR
 * `<arbiter>/work/<slug>` exists with its tip == the local tip (pushed & up-to-
 * date). Otherwise the branch is KEPT (unmerged / unpushed / a diverged un-pushed
 * amend = not safe). The REMOTE branch is NEVER deleted (a propose PR is built
 * from it). `--no-switch` keeps the branch too.
 *
 * Before integrating, the work branch is rebased onto the latest `<arbiter>/main`
 * (ADR §10): a clean rebase continues; a conflicting rebase is `--abort`ed and
 * surfaced as needs-attention — `complete` NEVER auto-resolves. It NEVER
 * `--force`es to main.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  completed (done-move + commit + integrate succeeded)
 *   1  usage/environment error, or a refusal (gate failed, nothing to commit,
 *      not on a work branch, rebase conflict needs the human)
 *
 * On the two FAILURE paths the human can't paper over — a red gate (without
 * `--skip-verify`) and a rebase conflict (ADR §10) — `complete` no longer leaves
 * the item dangling. Instead it routes the item through the shared
 * `needs-attention` mechanism (ADR §12): record the reason and
 * `git mv work/in-progress|done/<slug>.md → work/needs-attention/<slug>.md`, so
 * the stuck item is surfaced by `status` and returnable to `backlog/`. The
 * success and `--skip-verify` paths are unchanged. The exit code stays 1 (the
 * work did NOT complete); the outcome still names WHY (gate-failed /
 * rebase-conflict) and `routedToNeedsAttention` records that the move happened.

/**
 * Locate the slug's ledger record at a RENAMED done-position on the branch tree, to
 * survive a SELF-RENAMING FOLDER task (the `folder-taxonomy-reorg-and-rename`
 * migration).
 *
 * The trap: a task whose job is to `git mv` the ledger folders themselves (e.g.
 * `done/ -> tasks/done/`) runs through the runner's INSTALLED (pre-rename) binary,
 * whose compiled-in {@link workItemPath} still resolves `done` to `work/done/`.
 * When the agent has placed its OWN record at the NEW done-position
 * (`work/tasks/done/<slug>.md`) as part of the migration, the binary-known
 * `work/done/<slug>.md` does not exist, and the resolver below would crash with
 * `nothing to complete`, reaping the build.
 *
 * This scan is the layout-agnostic backstop: when the record is at NONE of the
 * binary-known ledger folders, walk `work/` and return true iff `<slug>.md` exists
 * directly inside a folder whose LEAF name is `done` (covering BOTH `work/done/`
 * and a renamed `work/tasks/done/`). It deliberately matches ONLY a `done` leaf:
 * a record left in a renamed POOL (`tasks/ready/`) is NOT a finished task and must
 * still refuse, not be mis-integrated as done. When this fires, the slug is treated
 * as already-done-moved by the agent into its terminal position, so the runner
 * SKIPS its own `git mv` (the existing `source: 'done'` / stranded-done path) and
 * just integrates the agent's tree as-is — no binary-vs-branch folder-name
 * reconciliation is needed.

 *
 * Called ONLY on the SUCCESS paths (`completed` / `already-integrated`), where
 * the durable `in-progress → done` (or `→ dropped`) move is already on
 * `<arbiter>/main` — so the lock is no longer holding anything in flight and is
 * cleanly released SECOND. The FAILURE paths (gate-failed / review-blocked /
 * rebase-conflict / prepare-failed) deliberately do NOT release here: those route
 * to needs-attention (the lock is marked `stuck`, not released, via the
 * needs-attention seam) and the item is still in flight, so the held lock is
 * correct.
 *
 * Best-effort + idempotent (a `not-held` is fine — the body may predate the lock,
 * or a crash-recovery `reconcileItemLockAgainstMain` may already have cleared it).
 * A release fault never fails an already-landed completion: the durable `main`
 * record is authoritative, and a stranded lock is exactly what recovery clears.

 * without merge noise.
 *
 * The ff is a COURTESY, NOT the safety-bearing step — the authoritative push to
 * `<arbiter>/main` already defined `complete`'s success. So the ff is NON-FATAL:
 * if local `main` has DIVERGED (unpushed commits the arbiter lacks) the ff cannot
 * apply; rather than throw (which would make `complete` exit non-zero even though
 * the merge ALREADY LANDED on the arbiter), we print a clear "rebase to sync"
 * message and return `false` (the caller records `localMainSynced: false` and
 * keeps `outcome: completed` / exit 0). Returns `true` on a normal ff.
 *
 * Only the diverged / ff-cannot-apply case is softened — the `fetch` and `switch`
 * stay `gitHard` (a genuinely different failure is NOT masked, per the task).
