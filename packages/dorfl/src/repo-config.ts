/**
 * The per-repo config layer.
 *
 * A repo may commit a `dorfl.json` at its root. It travels WITH the repo
 * (it is committed) and overrides the global `~/.config/dorfl/config.json`
 * FOR THAT REPO ONLY — so repo-local properties (how this repo integrates, its
 * acceptance `verify` gate, which remote arbitrates its claims) are agreed by all
 * collaborators and agents rather than living in one person's global config.
 *
 * Resolution is per-key, highest wins:
 *
 *   flag (where a command offers one) > ENV (DORFL_*) > per-repo file >
 *   global > built-in default
 *
 * The mechanism is multi-repo aware: each repo resolves against its OWN
 * `dorfl.json`, so repo A can be `merge` while repo B is `propose` in the
 * SAME run (see {@link resolveRepoConfig}).
 *
 * Only keys that are genuinely repo properties are honoured in the COMMITTED
 * per-repo file. Runner/host-only keys (`piBin`, `agentCmd`, `maxParallel`, …)
 * describe the runner or the host machine, NOT a single repo;
 * if present in a per-repo file they are ignored and reported with a clear
 * message ({@link loadRepoConfig}).
 *
 * The sharpened host-only principle (ADR §13): **host-only keys must come from a
 * per-machine source — a CLI flag, an `DORFL_*` env var, or the global
 * config file — NEVER the committed repo file.** The allow/reject split below
 * therefore governs ONLY the committed repo file; env (a per-machine source like
 * the global file / a flag) may set ANY key, host-only included (see
 * {@link envOverrides}).
 *
 * A repo with no `dorfl.json` resolves to exactly the global config —
 * behaviour is unchanged from before this layer existed.
