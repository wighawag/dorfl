/**
 * The **`advance` verb SKELETON** (spec `advance-loop`, task
 * `advance-verb-resolver`, US #1/5/6/18). `advance` is the SIBLING top-level verb
 * (NOT a `do` subcommand — `do` subcommands are REJECTED in the spec) that drives
 * a `work/` item ONE lifecycle rung toward "ready/built", reusing the SAME shared
 * `prefix:arg` resolver `do` uses (extended with the `obs:` namespace, see
 * {@link resolveAdvanceArg}).
 *
 * This module delivers the **classify → lock → execute SKELETON** — the contract
 * both drivers (the later one-shot/loop tasks) wrap:
 *
 *   1. **classify** — read-only, NO model, NO lock: read the item's two signals
 *      (`needsAnswers` + the sidecar's answered-state) and call the pure
 *      {@link classifyTick} to get the rung kind. A CAS loser will have spent ONLY
 *      this free classification.
 *   2. **lock** — take the `advancing` CAS borrow ({@link acquireAdvancingLock})
 *      for the classified rung, keyed on the item's `<type>-<slug>` identity. The
 *      expensive (agent/model) phase is ALWAYS post-lock, so a loser backs off
 *      having done ~nothing (a TOCTOU between classify and CAS is harmless — only
 *      the free classification is wasted, and the loser never starts model work).
 *   3. **execute** — WINNER ONLY: dispatch the classified rung to the
 *      {@link RungExecutor} seam, then release the borrow.
 *
 * The **rung BODIES** are now ALL filled (their own tasks): `surface`
 * (`advance-rung-surface`), `apply` (`advance-rung-apply`), and
 * `triage-observation` (`advance-rung-triage`) dispatch through the clearly-named
 * executor SEAM ({@link RungExecutor}); the build/task rungs ORCHESTRATE
 * `do`/`do spec:`. What this verb does NOT do (LATER tasks):
 *   - The two **DRIVERS** (one-shot sequential / loop) + `-n` + the gate-FAMILY
 *     WIRING that resolves `autoBuild`/`autoTask`/`observationTriage` and threads
 *     them into the build/task gate composition — task `advance-drivers-and-gates`.
 *     (This verb already RESPECTS `observationTriage` in the triage rung — the gate's
 *     resolution chain + the build/task gate composition is the drivers task.)
 *   - The bare `advance` (eligible-SET) form — it needs the pool scan / driver, so
 *     the verb here is a SINGLE named-item tick; the bare form errors clearly
 *     ("needs the driver task"). See the `## Decisions` block in the task.
 *
 * The build-task / task-spec rungs ORCHESTRATE the existing `do` / `do spec:`
 * machinery ({@link performDo}) — `advance` is a driver layered ON TOP, NEVER a
 * peer that duplicates the build/task path (ONE build path, ONE task path —
 * US #6).

 * Dispatch an answered MERGE-QUESTION (a sidecar entry stamped `kind: merge` by
 * the merge-question surfacer) through the EXISTING land primitive
 * (`performIntegration` with `committedRecovery: true` + `freshWorktreeGate:
 * true`) via the EXISTING per-job worktree seam (`workspace.ts` `createJob`).
 * The deterministic SIBLING of the agentic `decide()` content-decision (SPEC
 * `land-time-reverify-and-parallel-merge-ceiling`, task
 * `apply-rung-merge-disposition`; Stories #15, #16): a merge-acceptance has no
 * judgement content (the human's plain `merge | hold | drop` answer IS the
 * decision; the apply-time re-verify on the rebased tip is the real correctness
 * gate), so the apply rung KIND-CHECKS the sidecar BEFORE the agentic decider.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when there is no answered `kind: merge` entry to dispatch
 * (the apply rung then proceeds to the existing path — agentic for
 * observations, normal `applyAnsweredQuestions` for task/spec content questions).
 * Returns a {@link RungExecResult} when the dispatcher handled the rung:
 *
 *   - `landed` / `already-integrated` ⇒ the kept commit landed on `main` (or
 *     was already there); the dispatcher FALLS THROUGH to the normal apply path
 *     so the answer is recorded in the item body + the sidecar is resolved.
 *   - `refused` ⇒ the LAND was refused (RED re-verify on the rebased tip,
 *     rebase conflict, or pre-checkout failure); `performIntegration` routed
 *     the item to needs-attention through its own shared seam, so `main` never
 *     received a failing tree. The apply rung SHORT-CIRCUITS — the sidecar is
 *     LEFT IN PLACE so the open answer stays surfaced for a human follow-up.
 *   - `restale` ⇒ `strictMergeApproval` was ON and the merge-base moved
 *     between the surfacer's question and this apply; the apply rung appends
 *     a follow-up question + re-pauses (the human re-confirms against the new
 *     base).
 *   - `hold` / `drop` ⇒ no land; fall through to the normal apply path so the
 *     answer is recorded in body. The branch stays unmerged; a future
 *     surfacer pass may re-emit a merge-question.

	//    `ledger-status-per-item-lock-refs` US #1/#3/#18; ADR
	//    `ledger-status-on-per-item-lock-refs`). The rung kind is KNOWN here
	//    (`classification.kind`, classified pre-lock), so the tree-less-only policy
	//    lives HERE — where the rung is known — and `advancing-lock.ts` stays
	//    rung-agnostic (it only learns "unified or not" via `acquireUnified`). For a
	//    TREE-LESS rung (`surface`/`apply`/`triage-observation`) the advancing acquire
	//    ALSO takes the item's unified lock (`action: advance`) — these rungs have NO
	//    inner `do`, so the unified hold is what realises advance∥claim / advance∥task
	//    exclusion. For a BUILD-TASK / TASK-SPEC rung we do NOT take the unified lock
	//    at the advance layer: `performAdvance` ORCHESTRATES an inner `performDo` that
	//    ITSELF acquires the SAME `task-<slug>`/`prd-<slug>` ref (the create-only CAS
	//    with NO re-entrancy/auto-steal, per the ADR), so taking it here too would
	//    DEADLOCK the tick against itself. The inner `do`'s claim/task lock IS the
	//    single exclusion point for those rungs. The `work/advancing/<entry>.md` marker
	//    CAS is KEPT for ALL rungs (its removal is the capstone task #9).
