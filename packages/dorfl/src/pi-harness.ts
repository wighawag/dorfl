/**
 * The **pi** harness adapter (ADR §5) — the first real agent harness
 * `dorfl` drives. It fulfils the harness seam introduced by
 * `agent-workspaces` (`./harness.ts`): launch a job's work-agent command in its
 * worktree, and report liveness from **pi-native signals**.
 *
 * Two design commitments from the task + ADR §5, both encoded here:
 *
 *  1. **Invocation** is the standard work-agent prompt (the constant wrapper +
 *     the task's `## Prompt`, assembled by `./prompt.ts`) fed to the pi CLI on
 *     stdin, running non-interactively (`--print`) inside the job worktree.
 *  2. **Liveness** is reported from the **PID** (process alive?) PLUS a pointer
 *     to the pi **session file** (real activity + an audit trail) — explicitly
 *     **NOT filesystem mtime**: a live agent can think for minutes without
 *     writing any files, so mtime would mistake a thinking agent for a dead one.
 *
 * ## Session location: `--session <full-path>` (task `session-path-pi-default`)
 *
 * The adapter passes a **deterministic FULL session-FILE path** as `--session
 * <path>` (NOT `--session-dir <dir>`). The caller GENERATES that path once
 * (before launch, so `do --watch` can tail the known path) via {@link
 * generateSessionPath} and threads it in as `LaunchInput.session`; when omitted,
 * the adapter generates a default for its own cwd. pi creates+writes the session
 * at exactly that path (it CREATES a non-existent `--session` file) and
 * `--session` takes precedence over `--session-dir` (verified vs pinned pi
 * source). The default lands under pi's per-cwd sessions folder, so the
 * pi-remote dashboard sees the session and the in-place checkout stays clean.
 * The arg is ABSOLUTE and ends `.jsonl` — required, else pi treats it as a
 * session-ID lookup and exits 1 (see {@link generateSessionPath}).
 *
 * pi specifics stay BEHIND this adapter; the core (`run`, `status`, `do`) talks
 * only to the `Harness` interface. Where running real pi in CI is impractical,
 * the pi CLI is stubbed (see `pi-harness.test.ts`) via the injectable `piBin`.
 *
 * ## Seam contract (what an adapter promises the core)
 *
 *  - `launch(input)` runs the work-agent command for ONE job in `input.dir`
 *    (the worktree), feeding `input.prompt` to the agent. It returns
 *    `{ok, record, detail?}`: `ok` iff the agent completed successfully, and a
 *    `record` to persist in `.dorfl-job.json` carrying the **liveness
 *    anchor** (`pid`) plus the pi `session` FILE path. The core treats the call
 *    as blocking (it runs the test gate immediately after).
 *  - `isAlive(record)` answers liveness FROM THE RECORD'S ANCHOR (PID/session),
 *    never mtime, so a separate `status`/`do` process can re-derive liveness
 *    from a fresh process WITHOUT re-launching the agent.

 * An `await` is not a handle: node keeps a process alive for referenced HANDLES
 * (timers, sockets, child processes), and a suspended promise is none of those.
 * {@link PiHarness.launchAsync} deliberately drops every handle it owns the
 * moment pi exits (it destroys the stdio pipes and `unref`s the child so a
 * leaked grandchild's inherited FDs cannot pin the loop), and on the deadline
 * path it then keeps the promise pending across the process-group reap. In the
 * field that combination let the event loop go EMPTY mid-reap: node exited
 * normally with code 0, the suspended pipeline (checkpoint save, branch push,
 * lock release, writer-sentinel release, job-record update) simply never ran,
 * and the run reported SUCCESS while leaving the item locked and 90 minutes of
 * agent work uncommitted.
 *
 * So the launch holds an explicit REFERENCED keep-alive for exactly as long as
 * it is in flight, and an exit guard turns any remaining way of exiting mid-

	 * agent's answer from the `.jsonl` (final once pi exited, independent of
	 * stdout), then DESTROY our end of the stdio pipes so a leaked grandchild's
	 * inherited FDs release what they can. A lingering grandchild may still hold an
	 * OS pipe end open (keeping the event loop non-empty); the CLI verbs that call

 *
 * Studied (task `pi-harness-polish`, finding
 * `work/notes/findings/pi-harness-channels.md`): the recorded `--session <path>`
 * file remains the right audit pointer even against pi's other output surfaces
 * (`--mode json` stdout stream, `--mode rpc`, in-process SDK) — those are
 * transient stdio channels that do not survive the process, whereas the session
 * file is the versioned, dashboard-visible activity trail pi itself treats as
 * the audit artefact. PID stays the liveness anchor alongside it.

/**
 * Read the LAST assistant turn's output from the pi session `.jsonl` at
 * `sessionFile` — the agent's final ANSWER (`output`) PLUS the output-cap
 * signal (`outputCapped`, when the turn was truncated at the model's output-token
 * cap before it finished). Surfaced through the harness seam as
 * `LaunchResult.output` / `LaunchResult.outputCapped` (task `harness-agent-output`;
 * observation `tasker-review-edits-payload-caps-the-verdict-response`). Called by
 * BOTH `launch` (at return) and `launchAsync` (at `exit`), AFTER pi has exited so
 * the log is complete.
 *
 * It REUSES `watch-session.ts`'s {@link lastAssistantTurn} (one `.jsonl` parser,
 * not two). An absent file (pi never wrote it) yields `{}`, as does a log with no
 * assistant text — a read error is never thrown back into the launch.
 *
 * Studied (task `pi-harness-polish`, finding
 * `work/notes/findings/pi-harness-channels.md`, pinned against pi 0.73.1 +
 * session format v3): the session `.jsonl` is the right channel for output
 * because it is the only one that is BOTH post-mortem readable AND explicitly
 * versioned + migrated (`docs/session-format.md`). The `--mode json` STDOUT
 * event stream is not versioned and is transient; `--mode rpc` and the
 * in-process SDK cost more without solving anything the file does not. The
 * cross-harness `LaunchResult.output` seam (Option C) is a bare `string | undefined`,
 * so a future stream/HTTP-shaped harness (opencode-style) still fits: the file
 * shape lives BEHIND this reader and is not observable through the seam.
