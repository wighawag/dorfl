/**
 * The **pi** harness adapter (ADR §5) — the first real agent harness
 * `dorfl` drives. It fulfils the harness seam introduced by
 * `agent-workspaces` (`./harness.ts`): launch a job's work-agent command in its
 * worktree, and report liveness from **pi-native signals**.
 *
 * Two design commitments from the task + ADR §5, both encoded here:
 *
 *  1. **Invocation** is the standard work-agent prompt (the constant wrapper +
 *     the task's `## Prompt`, assembled by `./prompt.ts`) fed to the pi CLI on
 *     stdin, running non-interactively (`--print`) inside the job worktree.
 *  2. **Liveness** is reported from the **PID** (process alive?) PLUS a pointer
 *     to the pi **session file** (real activity + an audit trail) — explicitly
 *     **NOT filesystem mtime**: a live agent can think for minutes without
 *     writing any files, so mtime would mistake a thinking agent for a dead one.
 *
 * ## Session location: `--session <full-path>` (task `session-path-pi-default`)
 *
 * The adapter passes a **deterministic FULL session-FILE path** as `--session
 * <path>` (NOT `--session-dir <dir>`). The caller GENERATES that path once
 * (before launch, so `do --watch` can tail the known path) via {@link
 * generateSessionPath} and threads it in as `LaunchInput.session`; when omitted,
 * the adapter generates a default for its own cwd. pi creates+writes the session
 * at exactly that path (it CREATES a non-existent `--session` file) and
 * `--session` takes precedence over `--session-dir` (verified vs pinned pi
 * source). The default lands under pi's per-cwd sessions folder, so the
 * pi-remote dashboard sees the session and the in-place checkout stays clean.
 * The arg is ABSOLUTE and ends `.jsonl` — required, else pi treats it as a
 * session-ID lookup and exits 1 (see {@link generateSessionPath}).
 *
 * pi specifics stay BEHIND this adapter; the core (`run`, `status`, `do`) talks
 * only to the `Harness` interface. Where running real pi in CI is impractical,
 * the pi CLI is stubbed (see `pi-harness.test.ts`) via the injectable `piBin`.
 *
 * ## Seam contract (what an adapter promises the core)
 *
 *  - `launch(input)` runs the work-agent command for ONE job in `input.dir`
 *    (the worktree), feeding `input.prompt` to the agent. It returns
 *    `{ok, record, detail?}`: `ok` iff the agent completed successfully, and a
 *    `record` to persist in `.dorfl-job.json` carrying the **liveness
 *    anchor** (`pid`) plus the pi `session` FILE path. The core treats the call
 *    as blocking (it runs the test gate immediately after).
 *  - `isAlive(record)` answers liveness FROM THE RECORD'S ANCHOR (PID/session),
 *    never mtime, so a separate `status`/`do` process can re-derive liveness
 *    from a fresh process WITHOUT re-launching the agent.

	 * inherited stdout/stderr write end, `close` never fires and this promise never
	 * resolves — the `advance --watch` surface/triage/apply leg then finishes its
	 * work but its awaited launch hangs forever, burning a CI runner (and one of the
	 * `max-parallel` slots) until cancelled. `exit` fires the instant pi exits, so
	 * we key completion off pi's OWN death, not its descendants'. We still read the
	 * agent's answer from the `.jsonl` (final once pi exited, independent of
	 * stdout), then DESTROY our end of the stdio pipes so a leaked grandchild's
	 * inherited FDs release what they can. A lingering grandchild may still hold an
	 * OS pipe end open (keeping the event loop non-empty); the CLI verbs that call
	 * this path `process.exit(code)` after the awaited result, which is the
	 * belt-and-suspenders backstop bounding any such residual leak.
