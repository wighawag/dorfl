/**
 * **The shared gate→integrate BACK-HALF** of the per-item pipeline, extracted out
 * of `performComplete` (`complete.ts`) so BOTH the human `do`/`complete` path and
 * (a later task) the autonomous `run` path share ONE implementation of the
 * gate→integrate band. The exact ORDER depends on the fresh-worktree gate
 * (`freshWorktreeGate`, task `gate-on-rebased-tip-fresh-worktree`):
 *
 *   - fresh gate OFF (the pre-rebase gate, today byte-for-byte):
 *       verify (cwd) → review (cwd) → effective-mode decision → done-move →
 *       atomic commit → rebase-onto-arbiter → integrate.
 *   - fresh gate ON (the default; gate the tree that MERGES):
 *       done-move → atomic commit → rebase-onto-arbiter → verify (rebased tip) →
 *       review (rebased tip) → effective-mode decision → integrate.
 *
 * Either way `verify` is the deterministic FLOOR and runs FIRST, with the Gate-2
 * REVIEW (judgement) layered ON TOP and only on `verify`'s green — and (ON path,
 * MAINTAINER DECISION 2) BOTH run on the SAME rebased tip (the tree that actually
 * integrates), so verify-then-review holds on the merged tree, never split across
 * two trees. Any failure routes to needs-attention.
 *
 * It is the CORE in the head / core / tail decomposition (spec
 * `work/specs/tasked/run-do-integrate-convergence.md`): the caller-specific HEAD
 * (repo/arbiter/branch checks, source resolution, the `recovering` flag) and TAIL
 * (switch-to-main / `syncLocalMain` / delete-local-branch / `--no-switch` / the
 * propose next-step block, or — for `run` — the job-record + worktree reap) stay
 * in their respective callers; this is the band they share.
 *
 * It returns DATA ({@link IntegrationCoreResult}) and performs the needs-attention
 * ROUTING and the effective-mode DECISION — but NO caller-specific side effects
 * (no `git switch main`, no branch delete, no job record, no propose next-step
 * block). The human-vs-autonomous difference rides entirely on the {@link
 * IntegrationCoreInput.surfaceArbiter} field (human = unset ⇒ local-only routing;
 * autonomous = set ⇒ surface-on-main + push-branch routing) — DATA, never a
 * caller-identity flag.
 *
 * The band below was extracted (a pure refactor) from `performComplete`. A
 * resolved `merge` ALWAYS lands on a green gate (and, with review on, an
 * `approve`); `propose` always leaves the merge to a human. There is no
 * `merge`→`propose` downgrade — `merge` IS the auto-land mode. The effective
 * mode the core resolved is carried in {@link IntegrationCoreResult.integration}'s
 * `mode`; the tail reads it from there, NEVER from the requested mode.
 */

 * The outcome the core resolved. These already match `complete`'s
