/**
 * The engine-owned APPLY PERSIST (spec `advance-loop`, task `advance-rung-apply`;
 * AGENTIC apply, task `agentic-apply-retire-disposition-vocabulary`) — the half of
 * the APPLY rung the ENGINE owns. On `classify=apply` (ALL sidecar entries
 * answered), it applies the HUMAN's answers to the item ATOMICALLY (item body +
 * sidecar in ONE commit, via the sidecar contract's {@link applyAtomic}), then
 * EITHER:
 *
 *   - **append / re-pause** — when the apply has NEW questions to ask: append
 *     `qN+1…`, stay `needsAnswers:true`, re-pause (the "all answered?" flips back
 *     to false); OR
 *   - **dispose** — when the caller decided the SOURCE should be DISPOSED
 *     (`dispose` set): REGIME-POLYMORPHIC on the source's type (task
 *     `apply-disposition-delete-to-dispose-regime-polymorphic`, spec
 *     `surface-stuck-as-questions-and-retire-stuck-lock-state` decision #5):
 *     an OBSERVATION is `git rm`-ed with its sidecar in one revertible commit
 *     (reason in the message, git history = archive); a TASK is `git mv`-ed to
 *     `tasks/cancelled/` (RETAINED, `reason:` written into the moved body); a
 *     SPEC is `git mv`-ed to `specs/dropped/` (RETAINED). A task can NEVER be
 *     hard-deleted from here — dispose is the only path off the board; OR
 *   - **resolve fully** (the default) — clear `needsAnswers` + DELETE the sidecar
 *     in the SAME atomic commit (the invariant `needsAnswers:false ⟺ no active
 *     sidecar`); the item advances toward build by its normal lifecycle.
 *
 * **The disposition vocabulary is GONE** (task
 * `agentic-apply-retire-disposition-vocabulary`): the apply rung no longer reads a
 * per-entry `disposition=` token, no longer runs a most-decisive picker, and has
 * no `keep`/`triaged:keep` resting state. A sidecar entry is BINARY (no-answer |
 * answered); what to DO with a fully-answered OBSERVATION is decided by the
 * AGENTIC apply decision in the advance tick (`advance.ts` `applyRung` over the
 * shared `decide` engine), which then routes here (re-pause / dispose / via
 * `promoteObservation` for a mint). A signal is still-open, acted-on, or deleted
 * — there is no \"retain as resolved\" state.
 *
 * The work-item (task/spec) terminal MOVES (`tasks/cancelled`, `specs/dropped`) and
 * the stuck (lock `state: stuck`) LIFECYCLE state are a SEPARATE lifecycle concern (a
 * task/spec is dropped by its own lifecycle, not by a question answer) — they are
 * NOT routed from here any more (they were the removed disposition vocabulary).
 *
 * It is the SIBLING of {@link import('./surface-persist.js').persistSurfacedQuestions}:
 * that is the SURFACE rung's one-commit primitive (append-or-create + set
 * `needsAnswers`); this is the APPLY rung's (apply answers + resolve / re-pause /
 * dispose). Kept file-orthogonal so the rung bodies land in different tasks.
 *
 * **NEVER invents an answer (US #4).** The apply rung applies ONLY what the human
 * authored — the recorded `answer:` text. It does NOT fill, guess, or author an
 * answer; a SUBSET-answered sidecar is not even classified `apply` (the classifier
 * NO-OPs), so this is only ever called with a fully-answered sidecar. **ALWAYS
 * allowed (no gate)** — applying a human's answer is never gated, even with every
 * autonomy flag off (the engine, not this module, enforces the no-gate
 * sequencing).
 *
 * Like the surface persist, this is the LOCAL one-commit primitive over a working
 * tree (the throwaway-git-repo test pattern). The `advancing` CAS lock that makes
 * it WINNER-ONLY is held by `performAdvance` BEFORE this is called; this module
 * does NOT race the arbiter — that is the lock's job.

 * `apply-disposition-delete-to-dispose-regime-polymorphic`, spec
 * `surface-stuck-as-questions-and-retire-stuck-lock-state` decision #5): `git
 * mv` the item to `tasks/cancelled/` (task) or `specs/dropped/` (spec), with the
 * human's dispose reason written into the moved body's `reason:` frontmatter
 * (durable, in-file archive of WHY the item won't proceed — symmetric across
 * both regimes; the source of the moved item is the human's ratified answer),
 * then `git rm` the answered sidecar, all in ONE commit.
 *
 * ## Decisions (recorded here per task etiquette)
 *
 * - **`reason:` frontmatter, symmetric across task AND spec.** The acceptance
 *   criteria explicitly require the reason for the task branch; the spec
 *   branch is only required to `git mv` to `specs/dropped/`. We nonetheless
 *   write the same `reason:` marker onto a disposed SPEC too, because (a) the
 *   two regimes are the same shape ("disposed to terminal"), so asymmetric
 *   behaviour would be a surprise; (b) the spec regime's dropped/ folder had
 *   no in-file WHY at all before, so any adjacent surface (an operator
 *   inspecting `specs/dropped/`) would otherwise have to grep the commit
 *   history for the reason. Setting it uses the same {@link
 *   setFrontmatterMarker} the surface rung already uses for `needsAnswers`.
 *   The commit message still carries the reason too (belt + braces — the
 *   frontmatter is the durable in-file record, the commit is the audit
 *   history). If a reviewer disagrees they can flip the spec branch back to a
 *   bare `git mv` in one line — the task branch is the load-bearing acceptance.
 *
 * - **The sidecar is `git rm`-ed in the same commit as the mv.** A disposed
 *   item is no longer in the question-loop (the answer settled it), so the
 *   sidecar has no reason to survive at the terminal folder. Same commit
 *   preserves the sidecar's `needsAnswers ⇔ active sidecar` invariant.
 *
 * A TASK is NEVER `git rm`-ed on this branch (that is the invariant this
 * function exists to enforce): the disposal is a `git mv` to `tasks/cancelled/`,
 * a folder-move that git can revert with a single `git revert`.
