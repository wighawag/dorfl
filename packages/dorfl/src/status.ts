/**
 * `dorfl status` — the **operational dashboard of jobs** (ADR §4/§5/§12
 * in `docs/adr/execution-substrate-decisions.md`). Split out of
 * `agent-workspaces` so the substrate stays thin; this module owns the view.
 *
 * It lists the jobs under `<workspacesDir>/work/*` from their
 * `.dorfl-job.json` records + worktree state, grouped by state:
 *
 *   - **active** — `running` AND the harness reports the job still alive.
 *   - **failed / retained** — everything that wants a human's eye: a job the
 *     `needs-attention` mechanism flagged (with its reason, ADR §12), a `done`
 *     job whose worktree was never reaped (awaiting cleanup), or a `running`
 *     job whose harness reports it DEAD (crashed — the runner died mid-flight).
 *
 * **Liveness comes from the harness seam (PID / session), NOT filesystem mtime**
 * (ADR §5): a live agent can think for minutes without writing files, so mtime
 * would mistake a thinking agent for a dead one. The harness answers liveness
 * from the real signal.
 *
 * **Fetch-first (ADR §5/§6):** the per-mirror lock-ref + one-slug-one-folder
 * lint surfaces are read AFTER refreshing each registered hub mirror's `main` —
 * the old "scan is always offline" framing is RETIRED (it was the roots-local
 * model). A failed mirror fetch is NOT fatal: it WARNS and falls back to that
 * mirror's last-known `main`. The ledger read STRATEGY is unchanged
 * (`claim-ledger-vs-protected-main.md`); `status` only ensures the ref is fresh.
 *
 * It is strictly **read-only**: it inspects records/worktrees; it never claims,
 * runs, moves, or deletes (deletion is `gc`). It reuses the `gc` `discoverJobs`
 * primitive to enumerate jobs (it does NOT re-implement the work-area layout).
 *
 * Distinct from `scan`: `scan` answers "what work is in the *backlog* and who
 * can take it"; `status` answers "what is *running / stuck / awaiting cleanup*
 * right now". The retained-worktree + stuck-lock items are the "look here" set.
