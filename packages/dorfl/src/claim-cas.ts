/**
 * In-process TypeScript implementation of the atomic compare-and-swap claim from
 * `scripts/CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md`. This is the first-class `dorfl claim`
 * command (ADR §9: dorfl is the PRIMARY implementation of the claim
 * protocol; `scripts/claim.sh` is retained as the portable, zero-dependency
 * bootstrap / reference). The lock-substrate cut-over (prd
 * `ledger-status-per-item-lock-refs`) has since diverged it from `claim.sh`'s
 * body-move semantics — see the lock note below — but the exit codes are the same.
 *
 * It is async (each git call is a non-blocking `runAsync`) so two awaited claims
 * over the same slug genuinely race — the arbiter's per-item-ref CAS (not test
 * ordering) picks the single winner.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  claim landed (the per-item lock is held; the body stays where it rested:
 *       `tasks/ready/` normally, or `tasks/backlog/` under --allow-backlog)
 *   1  usage / environment error, or a readiness REFUSAL (unmet blockedBy)
 *   2  item not claimable (not in backlog, or lost the lock race to someone else)
 *   3  (legacy) push contention — no longer reachable: the per-item lock never
 *      falsely contends, so there is no retry budget to exhaust
 *
 * UNIFIED PER-ITEM LOCK (prd `ledger-status-per-item-lock-refs` US #1/#15/#16,
 * ADR `ledger-status-on-per-item-lock-refs`): a claim ACQUIRES the item's
 * per-item lock (`action: implement`) via the lock module and writes NOTHING to
 * `main` — the body STAYS at `work/backlog/<slug>.md`. The claimable predicate is
 * "in `backlog/` on `main` AND no lock held"; the held lock IS the claim. The lock
 * is acquired FIRST, so a lock `lost` (the SAME item is already locked) makes the
 * claim lose definitively (exit 2, NO retry budget). A subsequent claimability
 * re-check (the body left `backlog/`) RELEASES the lock (never orphaned). Because
 * claim touches no `main` (and no protected ref), a protected-`main` repo CAN be
 * claimed. The interim dual-write (`git mv backlog→in-progress` + a `main` claim
 * commit) is GONE.
 *
 * Before the claim runs, the HUMAN path's readiness guard (resolveReadiness) is
 * applied: a task with an unmet `blockedBy` is REFUSED (exit 1, outcome
 * 'not-ready') unless overridden; a `needsAnswers: true` task is WARNED about
 * but still claimed. The autonomous runner does NOT pass `humanPath`, so its
 * behaviour is unchanged (eligibility already filters those items upstream).
