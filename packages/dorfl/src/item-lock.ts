/**
 * The **unified item-lock module** (spec `ledger-status-per-item-lock-refs`, ADR
 * `ledger-status-on-per-item-lock-refs`). The runner's ONE lock primitive: ONE
 * lock per item, on a PER-ITEM hidden ref `refs/dorfl/lock/<entry>`,
 * acquired by an ATOMIC create-only push and released by DELETING the ref, with a
 * two-axis (`action` × `state`) entry. It collapses the old transient status
 * folders (`in-progress`, `needs-attention`, `tasking`, `advancing`) into ONE
 * lock keyed by item identity; `in-progress` = lock held active for `implement`,
 * `needs-attention` = lock held `stuck`.
 *
 * It GENERALISES the green tracer that proved the dangerous core end-to-end on a
 * bare `file://` arbiter (the tracer is now this file). The one production
 * difference from the tracer is the IDENTITY SEAM: callers pass a NAMESPACED item
 * identity (`task:<slug>` / `spec:<slug>` / `observation:<slug>` / `obs:<slug>`,
 * or a bare `<slug>` = task), and this module derives the type-encoded lock
 * `<entry>` (`<type>-<slug>`) through {@link resolveSidecarIdentity} — the SAME
 * single source of truth the sidecar (`work/questions/<type>-<slug>.md`) and the
 * work branch (`work/<type>-<slug>`) already use. There is deliberately NO second
 * identity scheme: a task, a spec,
 * and an observation that share a slug get DISTINCT lock refs, and the SAME item
 * under different actions shares ONE ref (so implement / task / advance on one
 * item are mutually exclusive by construction).
 *
 * It is NOT yet wired into claim/task/advance — those are separate, dependent
 * tasks — and deliberately does NOT touch `main`.
 *
 * WHY a per-item ref (not a marker on `main` or a tree on one shared ref):
 *   - **No false contention, no retry.** The ONLY writer that can contend on item
 *     X's lock is another writer FOR X — a GENUINE conflict the loser SHOULD lose.
 *     Two writers for DIFFERENT items touch DIFFERENT refs and never serialise. So
 *     acquire needs NO refetch-retry budget (contrast the shared-`main` CAS, which
 *     falsely-contends under parallelism and exhausts its retry cap → exit 3).
 *   - **Self-cleaning, no storage growth.** Acquire CREATES the ref; release
 *     DELETES it (not "empties" it), so the live ref set = currently-held items
 *     only. The lock commit is PARENTLESS (no `main` parent), so on ref-delete it
 *     is immediately unreachable and reclaimed by normal git gc — and the lock ref
 *     is fully decoupled from `main`'s object graph.
 *   - **Branch-inheritance impossible.** Nothing is in `main`'s tree, so a work
 *     branch cut from `main` inherits no lock state.
 *   - **Provider-agnostic.** A ref is a ref: the create-only / delete pushes work
 *     identically on a `--bare file://` arbiter and a real remote.
 *
 * ATOMICITY is the `--force-with-lease=<ref>:` (EMPTY expected) create-only push:
 * the arbiter accepts it ONLY if the ref is still absent; a racer who lost finds
 * the ref present and is rejected. No nonce gymnastics are needed here (unlike the
 * shared-`main` CAS) because the ref NAME is the identity — two acquires for the
 * same item race the SAME ref, and ref-level create-only is itself the mutex.

 *     but the item then reached its terminal folder by ANY path — human finish,
 *     re-drive, manual fixup+merge — leaving the stuck lock as an orphan the
 *     `main` record supersedes) → CLEAR it (`cleared-stuck-terminal`).
 *   - `main` is NOT terminal + the held lock is `stuck` → the GENUINE
 *     human-attention case (`kept-stuck`); NEVER auto-cleared here (a human
 *     resolves via `resume`/`requeue`/`release-lock`). This is the invariant
 *     the contract loosening MUST preserve.
 *   - `main` is NOT terminal + the held lock is `active` → the NORMAL in-flight
 *     state (`kept-in-flight`); the lock is doing its job, leave it.
 *   - no lock at all                                     → `no-lock` (at rest).
 *
 * Best-effort + idempotent: it NEVER throws (a fetch/read fault degrades to
 * `error`, leaving the lock untouched — the safe direction), and re-running it
 * on an already-reconciled item is a clean `no-lock`. The clear is the SAME
 * leased delete {@link releaseItemLock} uses, so it cannot race off a concurrent

 * `reaper-no-lock-outcome-benign-not-lost`, promote-slice follow-up

 * SHARED leased delete is REJECTED (the arbiter ref moved between our read and
 * our write) this function performs an EXTRA `git ls-remote <arbiter> <ref>`
 * round-trip to distinguish the two rejection sub-cases, and applies to ALL
 * callers — NOT only the reaper:
 *   - REMOTE REF IS EMPTY (a concurrent reaper / release-lock / requeue cleared
 *     the SAME stale lock first): the desired end state — benign. This function
 *     ALSO `git update-ref -d`s the LOCAL stale tracking ref as a SIDE-EFFECT
 *     (so a subsequent read in this clone sees the correct deleted state; a
 *     non-pruning fetch would otherwise leave a dangling local ref), then
 *     returns `no-lock`. Note the outcome-shape change: this rejection USED TO
 *     surface as `error` — it now surfaces as `no-lock` for EVERY caller. A
 *     caller that keys recovery / surfacing off `error` on this arm must be
 *     audited (see the follow-up task's `## Decisions` block).
 *   - REMOTE REF STILL EXISTS AT A DIFFERENT SHA (a genuine concurrent mutation
 *     — e.g. a racer just marked it `stuck`): back off rather than force —
 *     `error`.
 * Because the function name reads "reconcile" (read-style), the local
 * `update-ref -d` is a deliberate SIDE-EFFECT on the local clone's refs — it
 * only fires on this specific rejection arm and is otherwise invisible.

 * that cannot reach the arbiter must NOT pretend "no locks held" — it must fail so
 * the caller refuses to enumerate a pool it cannot trust (the
 * `scan-cwd-selection-pool-read-local-skips-held-lock-subtraction-offline-must-fail`
 * decision: offline selection FAILS, there is no `--local` fallback). The
