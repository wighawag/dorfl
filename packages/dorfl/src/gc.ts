 * The **reaper** for job worktrees, governed by the **provably-safe deletion
 * predicate** (ADR §4 in `docs/adr/execution-substrate-decisions.md`, the
 * authoritative source). Split out of `agent-workspaces` so the substrate stays
 * thin; this module owns deletion.
 *
 * A job's worktree is removed (auto, at end-of-job; or by `gc`) **iff**:
 *
 *   1. its working tree is **clean** (no uncommitted changes), AND
 *   2. its branch tip is **reachable on the arbiter** — either merged into
 *      `<arbiter>/main` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <tip> <arbiter>/main`),
 *      OR pushed as an up-to-date branch (`<arbiter>/<branch>` tip == local tip).
 *
 * Both hold ⇒ the worktree is genuinely redundant (reconstructible from the
 * arbiter) ⇒ remove. Otherwise ⇒ **retain for the human** (a retained worktree
 * is a reliable "needs attention" signal that dovetails with `watch`'s
 * surface-failures rail).
 *
 * The trigger is **provable safety, not "success"**: a successful-but-unpushed
 * job is retained; a job whose commits are on the arbiter is reaped. One rule,
 * no done-vs-failed special-casing. Removal is always `git worktree remove`
 * (+ prune), NEVER a bare `rm -rf` (which would leave a dangling worktree
 * registration on the hub).
 *
 * `--force` overrides the predicate (discard un-saved work) — it must be loud
 * and explicit, NEVER the default.
