## What to build

Once bare `dorfl` self-forwards from `dorflBin` (task `dorfl-bootstrap-self-forward`),
`install-ci`'s bespoke CI resolver SHIM — the `$PATH` shim in the emitted `dorfl-setup`
composite action that hardcodes a preference for `node_modules/.bin/dorfl` over the
global — is redundant and JS-specific. Converge it onto the generic mechanism so CI and
the laptop use ONE code path (JS and non-JS alike):

- The emitted `dorfl-setup` action's `dorfl` on `$PATH` should be the GLOBAL bootstrap,
  which now forwards to the repo's declared `dorflBin` by itself. The JS-only
  `node_modules/.bin/dorfl`-preference shim is removed OR reduced to a thin fallback that
  only applies when a repo declares NO `dorflBin` (so a JS repo that pins via a devDep but
  never set `dorflBin` still resolves the project-local copy — decide which at build time
  and record the choice).
- The generated workflow YAML / composite action stays coherent (the `verify` required
  check name, the git identity, the harness install are all unchanged); only the dorfl
  resolution step changes.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The emitted `dorfl-setup` composite action no longer depends on the JS-specific
      `node_modules/.bin/dorfl` shim as the ONLY pinning path: a repo that declares
      `dorflBin` gets the pinned dorfl in CI via the generic bootstrap forward.
- [ ] The decision (delete the shim entirely vs keep it as a no-`dorflBin` JS fallback) is
      made explicitly and recorded (a `## Decisions` note or ADR), with the emitted action
      matching that decision.
- [ ] The install-ci tests that assert the emitted `dorfl-setup` / workflow content are
      updated to the new shape and pass; the `verify` required-context name and other
      steps are unchanged (no regression to branch-protection wiring).
- [ ] `--fake` snapshot mode still writes to `.fake/` and sets no secrets (unchanged).
- [ ] Tests isolate any emitted-file fixtures in a scratch dir; `.github/` of the real
      repo is untouched by tests.

## Blocked by

- `dorfl-bootstrap-self-forward` — the generic forward must exist before the CI shim can
  defer to it.

> Keep everything else in the emitted CI (the `verify` required-check name, git identity,
