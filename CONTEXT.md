# CONTEXT — agent-runner domain language

The domain glossary for `agent-runner`. Agents and skills should use THIS
vocabulary when naming modules, tests, and discussing the system — it is the
shared language. Architectural rationale lives in `docs/adr/` (decisions); product
framing lives in `work/prd/`.

## What agent-runner is

A small TS/Node CLI that discovers, schedules, and runs work across many repos —
both as a guided **human loop** and as an unattended **autonomous runner** — on
top of a file-based `work/` contract and an atomic claim protocol. It is built by
dogfooding itself (it tracks its own work in its own `work/`).

## Core domain terms

- **work/ contract** — the on-disk system this consumes (defined in the
  `to-slices` skill): one markdown file per item, **status = the folder
  it lives in** (never a field). See that skill's `WORK-CONTRACT.md`.
- **slice** — one buildable work item: a tracer-bullet vertical slice, a markdown
  file `work/backlog/<slug>.md`. Has frontmatter: `slug`, `prd`, `humanOnly`
  (usually omitted), `needsAnswers` (usually omitted), `blockedBy`, `covers`.
  (All field names are camelCase — see WORK-CONTRACT.md.)
- **PRD** — a north-star doc in `work/prd/<slug>.md` a slice's `prd:` field points
  at. (The launch/framing doc; may be a hand-off snapshot.) Frontmatter: `slug`,
  `issue` (optional), `humanOnly`/`needsAnswers` (the slicing gate), `sliceAfter`
  (PRD slicing-order). Sliced-ness is RESIDENCE in `work/prd-sliced/` — there is no
  `sliced:` frontmatter marker (it was removed in `remove-sliced-marker-step-b`);
  see *PRD lifecycle* below.
- **ADR** — a decision record in `docs/adr/` (the *why* of OUR technical choices;
  durable). Format = the **standard** one, owned at
  `work/protocol/ADR-FORMAT.md`: `NNNN-slug.md`, one decision per file, body = 1–3
  sentences (context/decision/why), optional `status:`
  (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN` — most ADRs omit it).
  (Earlier slug-named/sectioned/`proposed`-lifecycle deviations were dropped; see
  `docs/adr/methodology-and-skills.md` §5/§5a. The two existing multi-decision files,
  e.g. `execution-substrate-decisions.md`, are grandfathered.)
- **capture buckets** — the THREE note-types under `work/` that are NOT work items
  and are **exempt from status=folder** (they don't flow/move; the folder is the
  inbox; they leave only by deletion): **`ideas/`** (proposed, pre-PRD;
  *editable*), **`observations/`** (spotted, unverified signals; *append-only*),
  **`findings/`** (*verified external/domain* ground truth — e.g. a
  reverse-engineered protocol; durable). Distinct from an ADR (what WE decided)
  and from an observation (internal “spotted, unverified” — NOT a finding). See
  WORK-CONTRACT.md.
- **slug** — content-derived, URL-safe id of an item (never a counter).
- **status (lifecycle)** — the folder: `backlog/` (claimable) → `in-progress/`
  (claimed) → `done/` (completed), or → `needs-attention/` (stuck) or
  `out-of-scope/`. Transitions are `git mv`.
- **autonomy gate (two axes)** — TWO orthogonal binary fields on slices AND PRDs
  (both default omitted = false): **`humanOnly`** (the DECIDED axis — *a human
  must drive this regardless of spec completeness*) and **`needsAnswers`** (the
  DISCOVERED axis — *unresolved questions block autonomous progress; the
  questions live in the body*). Orthogonal to lifecycle status. On a PRD they gate
  *slicing*; on a slice they gate *building*. (Supersedes the single-`humanOnly`
  gate, which replaced the three-state `afk` field.)
- **allowAgents policy** (`allowAgents`, per-repo) — *may agents claim undeclared
  items in this repo?* Default `false`; resolved like `integration`: flag
  (`--allow-agents`/`--no-allow-agents`) > per-repo > global > default.
- **blockedBy / eligibility** — an item is **agent-claimable** iff `needsAnswers`
  is not `true` AND `humanOnly` is not `true` AND `allowAgents` is `true`; it is
  **eligible now** iff also every `blockedBy` slug is present in the SAME repo's
  `work/done/`. Deps never cross repos.
- **PRD lifecycle (folders)** — a PRD flows through the SAME folder state machine
  as a slice, minus `done/`: **`work/prd/`** (ready to slice) → **`work/slicing/`**
  (the held LOCK, being sliced) → **`work/prd-sliced/`** (sliced, resting). The
  FOLDER is the SOLE source of truth for sliced-ness, exactly as `done/` is for
  slices (there is no `sliced:` frontmatter marker — it was removed in
  `remove-sliced-marker-step-b`; the release transition records sliced-ness purely
  by moving the PRD into `work/prd-sliced/`).
  Re-slice = `work/prd-sliced/ → work/prd/` (reopen-to-ready, mirroring
  `done/ → backlog/`).
- **sliceAfter** (`sliceAfter`, PRD-only) — PRD slugs that must already be
  **sliced** (resolved against `work/prd-sliced/` residence, mirroring
  `blockedBy` → `done/`) before the auto-slicer may slice this PRD — so its emitted
  slices can reference the real slugs of those PRDs' slices in `blockedBy`. Distinct
  verb/signal from slice `blockedBy` (which gates *building*, against `done/`).
- **needs-attention** — the post-claim **stuck** state (`work/needs-attention/`):
  a claimed item that couldn't finish (red gate, conflict, ambiguity, timeout,
  rejected review). The runner `git mv`s it here with a reason; a human resolves
  and moves it back to `backlog/`. Folder-native surfacing (no labels). (ADR §12.)
- **failure cause** — the CAUSE axis recorded on a needs-attention route + the
  `do` outcome / `run` `ItemStatus`, so a stuck item is not an undifferentiated
  "agent failed" (the cause drives the RECOVERY). It REUSES the existing terminal
  outcome vocabulary where it already fits and adds ONLY the two causes that
  vocabulary lacked — there is NO parallel naming scheme, and no new name
  duplicates an existing outcome (e.g. a red gate is the existing **`gate-failed`**,
  NOT a new `gate-red`):
  - **`gate-failed`** — the acceptance gate (`verify`) caught a genuine bug (fix
    the CODE). *(existing.)*
  - **`rebase-conflict`** — the rebase onto `<arbiter>/main` conflicted, aborted
    (resolve against main). *(existing.)*
  - **`review-blocked`** — Gate-2 (PR/code review) returned `block`. *(existing.)*
  - **`agent-stopped`** — the agent DELIBERATELY stopped on a drifted/ambiguous
    slice, or produced no change (re-scope/re-claim). *(existing.)*
  - **`agent-failed`** — the agent RAN but produced bad/empty output, OR the cause
    is UNKNOWN. The CONSERVATIVE GENERIC + safe default: an unrecognised cause
    stays here (the classifier never forces a wrong specific label). *(existing
    name, reused as the default.)*
  - **`transient-infra`** *(NEW)* — a harness-surfaced model/connection outage the
    harness surfaced AFTER its own retries, or a git/provider outage. RETRY the
    SAME work (the work is fine). Model-endpoint retries are the HARNESS's job
    (pi retries its own API); the runner only CLASSIFIES what is surfaced
    post-retry — it does NOT add model retries.
  - **`config-error`** *(NEW)* — a thrown CORE wiring/config error (e.g. `review`
    on with no `reviewGate` wired). Fix the WIRING, not the slice.
  The classification is BEST-EFFORT (lexical, from the surfaced error/detail) and
  is performed by the SHARED `classifyFailureCause` (`failure-cause.ts`) at BOTH
  the `do` and `run` failure-routing sites, so **`do` and `run` classify the SAME
  error the SAME way** (closing the old divergence where a thrown core error read
  as `usage-error` in `do` but `agent-failed` in `run`). (Slice
  `failure-cause-classification-model-vs-git-vs-agent`.)

## Claim & integration terms

- **arbiter** — the single git remote whose `main` ref serialises claims (GitHub,
  or a local `--bare` repo). Default remote name `origin`.
- **claim (CAS)** — atomically moving an item `backlog → in-progress` by pushing a
  micro-commit to the arbiter's `main` with `--force-with-lease`; the first push
  wins, losers get exit 2 and pick another item. Implemented by `claim.sh`
  (portable bootstrap) and `agent-runner claim` (the in-process version). This
  direct-`main` write is the **current (only) strategy behind the
  ledger-transition seam** (`docs/adr/claim-ledger-vs-protected-main.md`): the
  three `work/` transitions (claim / complete / needs-attention) route through the
  write seam, so a future strategy *could* differ — but today there is one, and it
  writes `main` exactly as described.
- **work branch** — `work/<slug>`, branched off the latest arbiter `main`, where a
  slice is built.
- **integration mode** — how finished work lands: **`propose`** (push a branch +
  request review; the default) or **`merge`** (direct to main, opt-in for
  trusted/low-risk repos). Resolved at integrate-time: flag > per-repo > global >
  `propose`. Never `--force` to main. (ADR §6, §11.)
- **verify (the gate)** — the per-repo acceptance command (`agent-runner verify`,
  e.g. `pnpm -r build && test && format:check`). The deterministic trust boundary:
  authoritative & non-skippable for the autonomous runner; default-on but
  `--skip-verify` for the human `complete`. (ADR §8.)

## Execution-substrate terms

- **job** — one claimed item being processed (there is NO long-lived "agent"
  identity; the unit is the job). (ADR §1.)
- **hub mirror** — one bare mirror per repo under `~/.agent-runner/repos/<key>.git`
  (the shared `repo-mirror` primitive); cheap shared object store.
- **worktree** — a job's isolated working tree off the hub mirror, under
  `~/.agent-runner/work/<work-id>/`, on branch `work/<slug>`. (ADR §2.)
- **human worktree** (`work-on`) — the HUMAN counterpart of a job worktree: an
  isolated worktree off the hub mirror on `work/<slug>`, but checked out under a
  **human-friendly** root (`humanWorktreesDir`, e.g. `~/worktrees/<key>/<slug>/`)
  so a person can edit several slices in parallel. Deliberately NOT under
  `~/.agent-runner/` (the agents' area) — so it never carries a human's secrets
  into an agent context. Two forms (`work-on <slug>` in-repo, `work-on <remote>
  <slug>` anywhere): the ONLY difference is the worktree's LOCATION — both claim
  the slug and branch off the freshly-fetched `<arbiter>/main` (same claim, same
  starting commit). `--copy <patterns>` copies named gitignored files (copy, not
  symlink; `--copy-from` required in the remote form) with a security notice. A
  binary can't `cd` your shell, so it prints the path + a `cd` hint; `--print-dir`
  emits the path only, for a shell wrapper:
  `work-on(){ cd "$(agent-runner work-on "$@" --print-dir)"; }`.
- **humanWorktreesDir** — config root for human worktrees, prompted + saved on
  first use (sensible suggestion, no silent default; chosen to NOT share a prefix
  with code dirs so shell tab-completion never collides). Never `~/.agent-runner/`.
- **work-id** — flat, deterministic key for a job:
  `<host-...>__<org>__<name>__<slug>` (the repo key with `.`→`-`, then the slug).
- **repo key** — hierarchical `host/org/name` with `.`→`-` per segment
  (`github-com/wighawag/agent-runner`).
- **deletion predicate** — a job worktree is removed only when its work is
  **provably on the arbiter** (clean tree AND branch tip reachable on the
  arbiter); otherwise retained (a retained worktree is a needs-attention signal).
  `gc` re-applies it. (ADR §4.)
- **harness seam** — pluggable interface for launching a job's agent and reporting
  liveness. Adapters: `null` (shells out to `agentCmd`, PID-only liveness) and
  **`pi`** (invokes the pi CLI with the work-agent prompt; liveness from PID + a
  pointer to the pi session dir/log). Selected via the `harness` config; jobs'
  liveness is resolved per-record to the owning adapter (`resolveHarness`).
  Liveness from the harness, **never filesystem mtime**. (ADR §5.)
- **integration seam** — `Integrator` with modes (`merge`/`propose`) × providers
  (`github` via `gh`, `none` = push + open-manually). Push is the safety-bearing
  action. (ADR §6.)

## The faces (commands) — see `docs/adr/command-surface-and-journeys.md`

Organised by two axes: **target** (the registry / one repo) × **doer** (agent /
human). The full model + rationale is the ADR; this is the glossary view.

- **Registry (what gets watched):** **`remote add <url> [--local]`** (register a
  target → create its hub mirror; `--local` = a `--bare` arbiter), `remote rm`,
  `remote ls`, **`remote find <folder>`** (discover `work/`-participating repos,
  toggle-add). The registered set IS the set of hub mirrors — there is no `roots`
  or `remotes` config field. Key = `host/org/name`; `remote add` guards against
  registering one project under two transports.
- **Autonomous — agent does it:**
  - **`run`** — the cross-repo, **parallel** daemon: scan the registry, claim up
    to `maxParallel`, run agents concurrently in job worktrees, integrate, loop
    forever (future service). **`run --once`** = one tick (debug/test the daemon;
    NOT the CI path).
  - **`do`** — the per-repo, in-place **worker**: claim+build+integrate in ONE
    repo, then exit. `do <slug>` / `do <prd>` (slice it) / `do` (auto-pick) /
    `do <slug>…` / `do -n <x>`; `--propose` (default) / `--merge`. **This is the
    CI command.** In a checkout it works in-place; `do --remote <r>` materialises a
    hub mirror + job worktree in the agents' area.
- **Human — do work yourself (optionally with your AI):**
  - **In-place** (takes over the current checkout, for when you need its real
    `.env`): **`start <slug>`** (claim + switch; `--agent` launches the harness)
    → build → **`complete`** (gate + done-move + integrate). **`resume <slug>`**
    re-engages an in-progress item. `claim`/`prompt` are low-level.
  - **Parallel** (isolated worktree, doesn't touch your clone): **`work-on
    <slug>` / `work-on --remote <r> <slug>`** — claim + worktree in the **human
    area**, `cd`s you in; `--copy` brings gitignored files (e.g. `.env`),
    `--agent` launches the harness. The human counterpart to `do`.
- **Ops:** **`scan`** (cross-repo queue — fetches the truth, warns+falls back
  offline), **`status`** (running/stuck/cleanup dashboard), **`requeue <slug>`**
  (needs-attention → backlog; the defer-don't-finish verb), **`gc`** (reap job
  worktrees, never mirrors), **`verify`** (run the gate standalone).

## Invariants (do not relitigate — see ADRs)

- The **runner owns all git-state transitions**; the build agent only writes code
  and gets the gate green (stated in-band in the agent prompt).
- **Status = folder, never a field** (conflict-safety). One file per item; no
  shared index; content slugs, never counters.
- Conflicts: **rebase-or-abort, never auto-resolve** → needs-attention. (ADR §10.)
- **Storage areas map onto the doer axis:** agent execution → agents' area
  (`~/.agent-runner/`, hub mirrors + job worktrees); a human doing the work →
  human area (`humanWorktreesDir`, never under `~/.agent-runner/`). The
  secrets-isolation boundary. (`command-surface-and-journeys` §2.)
- **adopt = skill, execute = command:** adopting the contract (setup, migrate,
  the slicing/PRD methodology) is protocol-layer (a SKILL, runner-agnostic);
  executing work (claim, `run`, `do`, integration) is implementation-layer (a
  command). Reinforces ADR §9. (`command-surface-and-journeys` §8.)
- **`scan`'s offline guarantee is RETIRED:** in the registry model the remote is
  the source of truth, so `scan`/`status` fetch-first (warn + fall back offline).
  (Supersedes the older roots-local "scan is always offline" framing.)

## Coherence (a first-class quality)

**Consistency and conceptual coherence are a stated quality of this project**, not a
nicety. THIS glossary + the ADRs are the single source of truth for what each term
means. A new flag / config key / status / verb / named concept MUST NOT silently
re-mean an existing term, mean two different things in two places, sit at the wrong
conceptual layer, or duplicate an existing concept under a new name. Before adding a
concept, check it against this glossary + the ADRs + the code; if it conflicts,
re-means, or overlaps, REUSE or RENAME rather than fork (or surface it). This is
enforced by the `review` skill's **conceptual-coherence lens** and the Gate-2 review
prompt, and prevented up-front by the CLAIM-PROTOCOL coherence check. Rationale: a
muddled concept that compiles is far more expensive than the question — every later
artifact that reuses the muddled term inherits the debt (the `autoSlice`-gated-the-
VERB-not-the-SELECTION miss is the worked example;
`work/findings/autoslice-gate-conflates-verb-autonomy-and-review-loop.md`).

## House style

pnpm monorepo (CLI in `packages/agent-runner/`), `type: module`, NodeNext, tsc,
prettier (tabs + single quotes), vitest, `commander`. Tests mirror the `claim.sh`
verification: throwaway git repos + a local `--bare` arbiter. Acceptance gate is
`pnpm -r build && pnpm -r test && pnpm -r format:check` (see `AGENTS.md`).
